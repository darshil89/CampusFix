## **Overview**

🔍 It is a comprehensive ticketing system aimed at facilitating seamless issue reporting for students. The platform allows students to raise concerns or report problems efficiently. I implemented role-based authentication to ensure secure and controlled access, where students, administrators, and support staff have distinct permissions based on their roles.

To promote collaboration and continuous improvement, we introduced a feedback mechanism, enabling users to provide input on the resolution process. Additionally, administrators can send notifications or emails to keep students informed about the status of their reported issues, ensuring a transparent and responsive system.
